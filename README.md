# aws-job-searcher

AWS Job Searcher is a tool that checks as a notifier for any available warehouse jobs at amazon. While amazon jobs page has its own notifier where you can subscribe to, it seems to not notify most of the time. This tool simply uses the api that is utilized from the jobs page and notifies any available jobs through email.

## Installation

Installation can go pretty manual from setting up in you own machine. Customize emails in your compose.yaml file (they must be separated by commas)
